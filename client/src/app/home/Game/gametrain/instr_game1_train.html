    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">You are assigned to a first-response task after a disaster occurred with a robot teammate.</p>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">You have access to the floor plan <strong>BEFORE</strong> the disaster but it may have changed due to damage incurred by the disaster.
        For example, some paths may be blocked and only your robot teammate that is working on the scene can sense these
        changes. So be aware. </p>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> In this scenario, your task is to team up with a remote robot that is working on the disaster scene.
       <br> <strong>The team goal is to search all the marked locations AS FAST AS POSSIBLE and your role is to help the robot by providing high-level
        guidance about what the next marked location to visit. </strong></p>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> <strong>1.</strong> To provide your high-level guidance to the robot, click on a room marked with
        <img src="marked2.jpg" height = "25" width = "25"> that is unvisited. This informs the robot that is the next room that you think it should visit. </p>

        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> <strong>2. </strong> After each move, the system asks you a question regarding to action the robot just performed: </p>
        <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"><strong>Do you think the robot is doing the right thing?</strong></p>

    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> You can <strong>change</strong> robot's target at any time by clicking on any of the marked rooms. Then the robot will move to visit the new ordered room.
    </p>  
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"><strong>3. </strong>The system continues asking you questions until the robot visits all of the marked locations.</p>
    <p style="width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"> Below you can see a sample map with a key for tile types. </p>
